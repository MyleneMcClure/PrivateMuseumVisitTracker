## üìã Smart Contract

**Contract Address:** `0xe4432488D78fd8CF32b096c385Ca251230427458`

**Network:** Sepolia Testnet (Zama FHE-enabled)

**Contract Name:** PrivateMuseumVisitTracker

## üéØ Core Concept

The Private Museum Visit Tracker leverages **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** technology to create a revolutionary solution for collecting and analyzing visitor data while maintaining complete privacy. This system addresses a critical challenge in the cultural sector: how to gather valuable visitor insights without compromising individual privacy.

### Privacy-Preserving Analytics

Traditional visitor tracking systems require museums to collect and store sensitive personal information in plaintext, creating privacy risks and regulatory compliance challenges. Our FHE-based solution encrypts all sensitive data **before** it reaches the blockchain, allowing statistical analysis to be performed on encrypted data without ever decrypting it.

### Key Innovation

- **Encrypted Visitor Attributes:** Age, satisfaction ratings, and interest levels are stored as encrypted values using Zama's fhEVM technology
- **Confidential Feedback:** Visitors can provide honest feedback knowing their individual responses remain completely private
- **Aggregate Analytics:** Museums can still derive valuable insights from visitor patterns and trends without accessing individual data
- **Blockchain Verification:** All data is immutably recorded on-chain, ensuring transparency and auditability while maintaining privacy

## üîí Privacy Features

### What Data is Protected?

1. **Visitor Age** - Encrypted using FHE (euint8)
2. **Satisfaction Ratings** - Encrypted 1-10 scale feedback (euint8)
3. **Interest Levels** - Encrypted 1-5 interest indicators (euint8)
4. **Visit Duration** - Time spent at exhibitions (euint32)

### What Data is Public?

- Exhibition names and types
- Total visitor counts (aggregate numbers only)
- Exhibition dates and status
- Registration timestamps

This selective encryption ensures privacy where it matters while maintaining the transparency needed for institutional accountability.

## ‚ú® Key Features

   - Record visit duration
   - Submit encrypted feedback

### For Museum Administrators

1. **Create Exhibition:** Set up new exhibitions with
   - Exhibition name
   - Type (History, Art, Science, etc.)
   - Start and end dates
2. **View Analytics:** Access aggregate statistics
   - Total exhibitions count
   - Total registered visitors
   - Visit counts per exhibition
   - All without accessing individual data

## üéì Use Cases

### Cultural Institutions

- **Museums:** Track visitor engagement across exhibitions
- **Art Galleries:** Understand artwork appeal and visitor preferences
- **Science Centers:** Measure educational impact and interest levels
- **Historical Sites:** Gather feedback while respecting visitor privacy

### Research & Analysis

- **Cultural Studies:** Analyze visitor behavior patterns
- **Exhibition Design:** Optimize based on aggregated feedback
- **Visitor Experience:** Improve services using privacy-safe data
- **Demographic Insights:** Understand audience composition without individual tracking

## üîê Privacy Guarantees

### What We Encrypt

- Individual visitor ages
- Personal satisfaction ratings
- Individual interest levels
- Sensitive personal preferences

### What We Never See

- Your actual age (only encrypted value on-chain)
- Your specific ratings (only encrypted values)
- Your individual behavior (only aggregate stats)
- Your identity linked to feedback

### How Privacy is Maintained

1. **Client-Side Encryption:** Data encrypted before leaving your browser
2. **FHE Computation:** Analytics performed on encrypted data
3. **No Decryption Keys:** Smart contract cannot decrypt individual values
4. **Zero-Knowledge Analytics:** Museums see trends, not individuals
